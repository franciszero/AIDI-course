    "There is a music streaming app called SoundCloud, that has been using their music streaming app and collecting data on songs and user activity and their aim is to analyze this data especially understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they are not making use of a NoSQL db and they have the data stored as a CSV file, thus its difficult for them to query the data. So our task is to create a NoSQL database for helping them with the analysis."
