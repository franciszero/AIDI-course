        "## **CONCEPT 1: What is Numba?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Numba is a **just-in-time, type-specializing, function compiler** for accelerating **numerically-focused** Python. Let's break down those terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **function compiler:** Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions. Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function.\n",
        "- **type-specializing:** Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using. Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow. In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
        "- **just-in-time:** Numba translates functions when they are first called. This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using. This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application\n",
        "- **numerically-focused:** Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like int, float, and complex. There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU. To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common way to use Numba is through its collection of decorators that can be applied to your functions to instruct Numba to compile them. When a call is made to a Numba decorated function it is compiled to machine code “just-in-time” for execution and all or part of your code can subsequently run at native machine code speed!\n",
        "\n",
        "Numba supports CUDA GPU programming by directly compiling a restricted subset of Python code into CUDA kernels and device functions following the CUDA execution model. Kernels written in Numba appear to have direct access to NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays are transferred between the CPU and the GPU automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Documentation](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cuda/index.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Terminology**\n",
        "* **host**: the CPU\n",
        "* **device**: the GPU\n",
        "* **host memory**: the system main memory\n",
        "* **device memory**: onboard memory on a GPU card\n",
        "* **kernels**: a GPU function launched by the host and executed on the device\n",
        "* **device function**: a GPU function executed on the device which can only be called from the device (i.e. from a kernel or another device function)\n",
        "\n",
        "Most CUDA programming facilities exposed by Numba map directly to the CUDA C language offered by NVIDIA. Therefore, it is recommended you read the official [CUDA C programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## **CONCEPT 2: How does Numba work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Numba reads the Python bytecode for a decorated function and combines this with information about the types of the input arguments to the function. It analyzes and optimizes your code, and finally uses the LLVM compiler library to generate a machine code version of your function, tailored to your CPU capabilities. This compiled version is then used every time your function is called.\n",

        "- `@overload` - register your own implementation of a function for use in nopython mode, e.g. `@overload(scipy.special.j0)`. [Docs are here](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/extending/high-level.html#high-level-extending).\n",
